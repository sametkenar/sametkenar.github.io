Data Scientist - Statistician passionate about turning complex business datasets into clear, actionable insights. With a B.Sc. in Statistics from METU and hands on experience as a Data Science Analyst at the Presidency of TÃ¼rkiye Human Resources Office, I couple strong quantitative fundamentals with real world decision making contexts. I design end to end solutions, data pipelines, predictive models, dashboards using Python, R, SQL and modern machine learning frameworks, translating technical findings into stories that guide policy, streamline operations and drive business value. Curious, collaborative and impact-driven, I thrive on bridging numbers and people to deliver data informed strategies.
