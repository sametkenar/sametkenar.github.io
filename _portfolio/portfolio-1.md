The modern football uses data-driven analysis methods to evaluate player performance more objectively. Understanding and correctly classifying the roles of players on the field plays an important role in the decision making processes of technical teams.

After eliminating missing data, various machine learning models are trained to evaluate the classification performance for each position.
